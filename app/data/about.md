#### What I'm looking for
I loved working for the public sector. Contributing to the common good inspired me to work harder and think more creatively than I ever did in the private sector. However, after 6 years of writing code for government, non-profits, B-corps and definitely-not-B-corps, I'm looking for a change. I want to have a say in how our government uses technology, not just create it. Specifically, I think I could maximize my impact in the public sector by:
<br><br>
- representing government when it deals with software contractors
- decreasing budget expenses by migrating to the cloud and open source technologies
- advising on emerging technology governance (AI, IoT, blockchain, etc.)
<br>


#### Policy issues I want to work on

Technology can make the government more efficient, but what use is efficiency if the government doesn't work for the people? For too long, our nation's policies have work for some, but not for all. I welcome any opportunity to advance progressive policies, especially in the following areas (writing samples provided for select topics):

- [Partisan gerrymandering](https://andrewgbourne.com/AmendmentXXIX_PartisanGerrymandering.docx)
