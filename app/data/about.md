#### What I'm looking for
After 6 years of writing code for government, non-profits, B-corps and definitely-not-B-corps, I'm looking for a change. I want to help government use technology better.
This could take the form of:
<br><br>
- making sure government interests are properly represented when interacting with software contractors
- modernizing government tech stacks, saving engineering hours and money
- using technology to research, and then advocate for, public policy changes
- advising on emerging technology governance (AI, IoT, blockchain, etc.)
- many other directions

I'm also looking for opportunities in government outside of technology. I want to make government services fast, easy and accessible. Technology can improve service delivery, but it is one solution among many. I welcome any opportunity to improve American government.

#### Policy issues I want to work on

I'm particularly motivated by the following issues. If available, I've linked my written work on the issue:

- [Campaign finance reform](/documents/AmendmentXXVIII_CampaignFinance.docx)
- [Disenfranchisment](/documents/ThePeoplesCheck_VotingRightsAndExecutiveAbuse.docx) (see pages 5-13)
